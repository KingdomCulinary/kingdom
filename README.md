### Purpose

The purpose of this dev branch is to development a C.R.U.D. React application using version control. This work will help me begin to build a portfolio of skills and accomplishment that can be shared in the future. And now since I have a minimum viable product to use for my project, I will focus in on the project requirements.

## App Descriptions
GLOW is a social media app for Great Lovers of the World. This week I focused on building a C.R.U.D. application using the components from last weeks project. I built a basic post, added functionally to add the post, use the splice method to delete an array item and added validation to the post submit.
